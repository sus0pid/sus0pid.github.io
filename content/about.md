I'm a PhD candidate at University of Edinburgh, where I do research in network security and privacy. I've invesgated the security problems in the anonymous communication system with [Tariq Elahi](https://sites.google.com/view/tariqelahi/home). I've also recently tried my hand at network protocol security for datacenter communciations.
My supervisor is [Michio Honda](https://micchie.net).

Before I joined UoE, I studied computer science (B.Eng) and cybersecurity (Master) at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) in China supervised by Prof. [Zhe Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Em0jNiUAAAAJ&hl=en). I also worked with [Pawel Szalachowski](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=kbU4kW8AAAAJ&hl=en) during a visit at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

In my free time, I like cycling, experimenting with different recipes, and reading psychology books, among other things!
