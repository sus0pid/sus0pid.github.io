I am a PhD candidate at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Michio Honda](https://micchie.net). My research focuses on network security in datacenter communications, with current projects on transport-level encryption for datacenter networks and TLS authentication architectures for high-performance environments.

Previously, I worked on security issues in anonymous communication systems with [Tariq Elahi](https://sites.google.com/view/tariqelahi/home).

Before I joined UoE, I studied computer science (B.Eng) and cybersecurity (Master) at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) in China supervised by Prof. [Zhe Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Em0jNiUAAAAJ&hl=en). I also worked with [Pawel Szalachowski](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=kbU4kW8AAAAJ&hl=en) during a visit at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

In my free time, I like cycling, experimenting with different recipes, and reading psychology books, among other things!
