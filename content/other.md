<q> Life is no straight and easy corridor along which we travel free and unhampered, but a maze of passages, through which we must seek our way, lost and confused, now and again checked in a blind alley.
But always, if we have faith a door will open for us, not perhaps one that we ourselves would ever have thought of, but one that will ultimately prove good for us.

<!-- * Splash, UCSD
* In the spring of 2014, I volunteered as an English teacher for 6 weeks in Luang Prabang, Laos, for Global Vision International.
* Almost every summer since I was 16 (before I moved from Sweden) I worked as a sailing instructor, either as a volunteer at Vässarö or as an instructor for the sea scouts in Solna, Stockholm, and later as the main instructor of the sailing school in Träslövsläge, Varberg. -->
