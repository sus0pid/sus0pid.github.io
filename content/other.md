<q> Life is no straight and easy corridor along which we travel free and unhanpered, but a maze of passages, through which we must seek our way, lost and confused, now and again checked in a blind alley.
But always, if we have faith a door will open for us, not perhaps one that we ourselves would ever have thought of, but one that will ultimately prove good for us.

I say if we replace the word "life" with "PhD", it'll still make perfect sence;)
